!urlq <query>
    List all entries which haves a url that matches,
    or have a title that matches, the search query.
    The query also matches substrings and is not case
    sensitive. The query will be tokenized by splitting
    on whitespace. This command is limited to the top
    25 results.
    Good luck using this :p (to be refined at a later date)
